Hi, Jane. This is Mike. I'm coming back to you on behalf of the new premium customer rapid delivery process definition. I have talked to Ben Smith from controlling and controlling definitely 
wants this new dashboard to see where our customers are located. So we need to adjust our premium customer rapid delivery process by adding a new activity called update dashboard. I have also 
talked to Dave from IT support and we agreed that the corresponding data for that part of the delivery process will be stored in a new custom table called the ZSOCD which we will be using in addition 
to the regular tables. Please make sure that everyone involved is updated on this and if you have any questions please come back to me anytime. Thank you and goodbye.
